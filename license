# grain network license

**grain style zig workspace**

this workspace contains grain network core components written in pure zig,
following grain style methodology: patient discipline, explicit limits,
sustainable practice, and code that teaches.

## licensing

all code in this repository is triple-licensed for maximum freedom and compatibility:

- **mit license** — see `license-mit` for permissive open source use

## grain style philosophy

code is a teaching tool. every line should help the next generation understand
not just how something works, but why it works. we write code that lasts,
code that teaches, code that grows sustainably like grain in a field.

when you use this code, you're invited to learn from it, teach with it,
and help it grow. that's the grain network way.
